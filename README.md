# SF_NN
Neural network classifier for SF

Will improve upon this readme as time goes on. 

For now, keep the two files in the same folder. 
Change the path variables in runShapeClassify.py to the path that contains your data. 
After activating anaconda tensorflow environment, run "python runShapeClassify.py"

runShapeClassify.py

Main code to load in data and train network. Will also test on validation data (test data) and display results.

sf_nn_utils.py

Code where helper functions for main code are written. Functions are imported at the beginning of runShapeClassify.py
